# Task 6: Automate Instance Bootstrap with User Data

We will automate instance bootstrap using user data in Amazon EC2. We'll explore what user data is and how to use it to customize instances during launch. Using Terraform, we'll create and configure our instance with user data, which will execute scripts and commands on the instance during bootstrapping.
