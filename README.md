# Task 2: Networking in the Cloud, Deploying Our First VPC

We will introduce networking in the cloud through Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in AWS. We'll cover the components of VPCs, including subnets, security groups, and routing tables, and how they work together. Using Terraform, we'll deploy our first VPC, gaining hands-on experience with cloud networking.
