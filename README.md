# Task 9: Distributing Traffic using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

We will explore how to distribute traffic using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in Amazon Web Services (AWS). We'll start by understanding what ELB is and how it works to distribute traffic across multiple instances. Then, we'll use Terraform to create and configure an ELB, including its listener and backend instances.
